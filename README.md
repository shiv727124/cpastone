A Multi-Tiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Internet of Vehicles
Modern vehicles, including connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles, nowadays involve many electronic control units connected through intra-vehicle networks to implement various functionalities and perform actions. Modern vehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything technologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks targeting both intra-vehicle and external networks due to the large attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have focused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on machine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this paper, the vulnerabilities of intra-vehicle and external networks are discussed, and a multi-tiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an anomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on vehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system can accurately detect various types of known attacks on the CAN-intrusion-dataset illustrating the external vehicular network data. The proposed MTH-IDS framework consists of two traditional ML stages (data pre-processing and feature engineering) and four tiers of learning models:

1. Four tree-based supervised learners — decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extra trees (ET), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) — used as multi-class classifiers for known attack detection;

2. A stacking ensemble model and a Bayesian optimization with tree Parzen estimator (BO-TPE) method for supervised learner optimization;

3. A cluster labeling (CL) k-means used as an unsupervised learner for zero-day attack detection;

4. Two biased classifiers and a Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process (BO-GP) method for unsupervised learner optimization.
